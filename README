Mechforce by Kari Vatjus-Anttila

Mechforce is a Battletech simulator inspired by the old Amiga game called Mechforce. 
This program tries to mimic the look and feel of the Amiga version and tries to add some 3D features to it also. 
So user can basically choose whether to play the game with the classic style Amiga graphics or with the new ones. 

This project is my first which utilizes OpenGL and SDL so this project will be a learning experience for me also

Mechforce will compile on Linux and Windows with cmake. On Windows systems one should just modify few paths inside
CMakeModules/*.cmake to point to the right include directories so Windows platforms can locate Freetype and pals correctly. 
On Linux systems no modifications are needed. One should just install the dependencies necessary.

[hint]
One should make a symbolic link in /usr/include like this: ln -s /usr/include/freetype2/freetype /usr/include/freetype
or Cmake will give you an error that Freetype is not found.
[/hint]

Dependencies:

OpenGL
SDL
SDL_mixer
Freetype
FreeImage
FTGL

Lets hope that I dont encounter too many problems on the way! Perhaps some day there will be a working Battletech simulator up and running. Stay tuned!
